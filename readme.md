# This repository contains the added work for the PPD Project on the subject of Few Shot Clustering 

The submodule added in the repo is a link to the original few-shot-clustering repo but updated and modified to handle a new clustering method using the seed words generated by chatgpt

the "code" subdirectory contains the python scripts to run the tests using the original methods which are :

- Pairwise clusteing 

- Keyphrase expansion clustering

the scripts to use the seed words clustering are two, one is for the initiation of the seed words from the available datasets, and a main.py file that is used to run the tests using the same data.

the results are generated in a .txt file in the same directory.
